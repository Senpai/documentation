[New Relic Pro](http://newrelic.com) offers a wide array of metrics that provide a nearly real-time look into the performance of a web application and is provided to all sites on Pantheon for free.

Using New Relic not only makes it easy for you to monitor to your performance, but it can also speed up the support process by helping our support team visualize corresponding performance and symptoms.

## Enable New Relic Pro
To enable New Relic Pro on your Pantheon site, select the **New Relic** tab on your Site Dashboard, and click **Enable New Relic Pro**. New Relic monitoring is automatically enabled for all application servers added to the site, including Multidev environments.

You should visit your site in the browser a couple of times to generate data in New Relic. After a few minutes pass, go to the New Relic workspace on your Dashboard, and click **Open New Relic**.

The New Relic interface provides severals views that display information about various aspects of your website's performance.

## End-User Overview

![End-User Interface](/source/docs/assets/images/new-relic-end-user.png)

1. The **Browser Page Load Time** represents the average time it takes the browser to process and render the page once Nginx has sent out the data. 
2. The **Apdex Score** attempts to break down the end-user response times into three categories based upon load-time thresholds.
<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
<h4>Note</h4>
The apdex is not the most accurate representation of your sites' load-times. It is simply there to give you a broad idea. The provided slow traces are the key to figuring out why your site is running poorly.</div>
3. **Page Views** provides the number of page views per minute.
4. The **Apdex & Top States by Load Time** presents a visualization of load times based on region; these can be viewed internally to the United States or globally.
5. **Recent Events** logs the most recent events.

## Appserver Overview

![Appserver Overview](/source/docs/assets/images/new-relic-overview.png)

1. The **response time** represents the duration that it takes for the request to be received by Nginx, processed by the application server, and returned to the client for processing and rendering. The end-user response time is different than the appserver response time, as the end user's response time is affected by variables such as connection speed, network latency, and browser.
2. The **slow transactions** represent points of the process that take longer than a defined amount of time. This feature can be used to test a site against a set of timed-expectations to discover and fix problems.
3. **Errors** captures and logs any error generated by the application stack.
4. **Throughput** displays the number of requests per minute.
5. The **Servers** display shows the number of [application containers](/docs/application-containers), or appservers, associated with that environment.

## Only Log Authenticated Users

If your site consists of mostly authenticated traffic, it can be useful to exclude anonymous users who are using your site's page cache. This technique will still capture form submissions, including logins and contact pages. Similar logic can be used to disable New Relic on certain paths, such as `/admin` in Drupal or `/wp-admin` in WordPress.  

### Drupal
To disable New Relic for anonymous traffic on Drupal-based sites, add the following to your `sites/default/settings.php`:

```
// Disable New Relic for anonymous users.
if (function_exists('newrelic_ignore_transaction')) {
  $skip_new_relic = TRUE;
  // Capture all transactions for users with a PHP session.
  foreach (array_keys($_COOKIE) as $cookie) {
    if (substr($cookie, 0, 4) == 'SESS') {
      $skip_new_relic = FALSE;
    }
  }
  // Capture all POST requests so we include anonymous form submissions.
  if (isset($_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD']) && $_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'] == 'POST') {
    $skip_new_relic = FALSE;
  }
  if ($skip_new_relic) {
    newrelic_ignore_transaction();
  }
}
```

### WordPress
To disable New Relic for anonymous traffic on WordPress sites, add the following to your `templates/<your_template>/functions.php`:

```
// Disable New Relic for anonymous users.
if (function_exists('newrelic_ignore_transaction')) {
    $skip_new_relic = !is_user_logged_in();

    // Capture all POST requests so we include anonymous form submissions.
    if (isset($_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD']) &&
        $_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'] == 'POST') {
        $skip_new_relic = FALSE;
    }

    if ($skip_new_relic) {
        newrelic_ignore_transaction();
    }
}
```

## Remove Multidev Environments in New Relic
After deleting a Multidev environment from your site, you'll need to manually [remove them in New Relic](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/maintenance/remove-applications-servers).  

1. From your Dashboard, select the **New Relic** tab, and **Open New Relic**.  
2. From the New Relic menu bar, select **APM** > **Applications**.  
3. Wait until the color-coded health status to turn gray, then select the app's gear icon.
4. Select **Delete app**, and click the confirmation button.

## Disable New Relic

1. From your Dashboard, select the **New Relic** tab, and **Open New Relic**.

## Frequently Asked Questions

#### How do I change the New Relic site owner now that our Pantheon site has a new site owner?


#### How can I share a link to a particular metric?

In the New Relic performance page, click **Permalink**. This will preserve the current time window and take the link recipient to the same page you're currently looking at.

#### How much is New Relic Pro?

Pantheon provides New Relic Pro for all sites at no cost.

#### Will turning on New Relic Pro slow my site down?

Basically no, New Relic will not make your site slower. There is a very small amount of overhead, but it's imperceptible. The amount of available metrics useful for debugging and improving performance far outstrips the negligible difference.

#### What is the difference between app server response time and browser page load time?

App server response time measures how the page was built on Pantheon, including PHP execution, database, Redis (if used). Browser page load time measures the additional time of client-side page rendering, DOM processing, and how long it took to transfer to the client. While a fast app server response time is optimal, a slow browser page load time indicates a bad user experience. Some causes are unaggregated or uncompressed scripts and stylesheets, invalid markup, or unoptimized client-side code (like JavaScript).

#### Can I use my existing New Relic license with my Pantheon site?

New Relic Pro is automatically provisioned for your site. Unfortunately, you cannot use your existing license.

#### Why are servers listed in New Relic with no data?

Because Pantheon's runtime matrix runs your application across many containers simultaneously, it's common to see old containers with no reporting data as your application shifts around. This is not a cause for concern.
